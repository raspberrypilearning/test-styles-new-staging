## Does a challenge `h2` title confuse the step numbering?

One time when I was a kid I was at an arcade in Scarborough and I was happily playing Street Fighter 2 by myself, and then this other kid came over and put his 50p in the thing and the game announced "A Challenger Appears" and then he completely kicked my ass and I've been salty about it ever since.

Dumb kid with his living-in-Scarborough and his can-go-to-the-arcade-and-practice-Street-Fighter-whenever-he-wants. I bet he voted for Brexit as an adult. I bet he has kids but they don't love him. I bet he's lonely. I bet his Christmasses are miserable. What an awful person he is.

And that's why I'm not a massive fan of Street Fighter.
